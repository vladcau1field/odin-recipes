      this easy onigiri recipe is also fun to make! these rice balls are a
      staple of japanese lunchboxes (bento). you can put almost anything in
      these rice balls; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef,
      pork, turkey, or tuna with mayonnaise.

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
      <li>5 ½ cups water, divided/li></li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>t¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
      <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. combine washed rice
        and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. bring to a boil over high heat,
        stirring occasionally. reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until
        water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. let rice rest for 15 minutes to
        continue to steam and become tender. allow cooked rice to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen
        hands before handling rice. divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions.
        use one portion of rice for each onigiri.
      </li>
      <li>
        divide one portion of rice in two. create a dimple in rice and fill with
        a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. cover with remaining portion of
        rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. gently press
        rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle
        with sesame seeds. repeat with remaining portions of rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
